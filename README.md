# Say Frontend Take Home Project

## Getting started

1. Fork this repository.

2. Make sure you have `yarn` installed. [https://yarnpkg.com/en/](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).

3. Run `yarn install` to install packages. Then `yarn start` to start local server.

4. (A basic react app is provided, but if you would like to use a different library/framework, that is fine, just provide a README on how to install and run your project).

## The project

1. Fetch data from the url provided: [https://www.reddit.com/.json](https://www.reddit.com/.json).

2. Group the posts together by subreddit.

3. Sort the posts in each subreddit based on upvote, i.e. most upvotes to fewest.

4. For each group of posts in a subreddit, display the subreddit name. Each post of the subreddit must display title, image (if there is one), date (formatted as MM/DD/YYYY), upvotes, and a link to the actual post.

5. Create a UI that reflects how you have parsed the data. Designs are not provided, so feel free to make this look however you would like.

6. Once you are done, push the fork to your own github account (private is fine, you will just need to grant us access to it).

## Things to keep in mind

1. This should be a ~2 hour challenge, so do not fret about making it pretty, but make it user friendly.

2. Design should be responsive.

3. UI reflecting loading and error states is encouraged.

4. Feel free to use whatever dependencies you would like.
